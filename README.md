# Code.init '24 - Problem Statement 2 - Alumni Yearbook

## Description
Develop an Alumni Yearbook Interface to serve as a digital repository and interactive platform for alumni from educational institutions to reconnect, reminisce, and stay connected with their alma mater. The interface should allow alumni to create profiles, share memories, update contact information, and network with fellow alumni. Additionally, the platform should feature a virtual yearbook section where users can browse through past yearbooks, view photos, read class notes, and explore the achievements and milestones of alumni over the years.
